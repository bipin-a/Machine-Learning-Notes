# Machine-Learning-Notes
This repository serves as a personal journal, so when I turn 35 I can still remember the foundations behind Machine Learning. 
Encourage reader to point out mistakes and put up a PR for a correction. 
Additional contributions beyond fixing mistakes will considered after the foundations for this journal has been placed.

5. Covariance
6. Derivatives

## Calculus 
1. Convex Optimization 
2. Hessian Matrix
